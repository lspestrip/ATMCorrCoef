# ATMCorrCoef

CMB ground-based experiments must deal with atmospheric fluctuations that introduces spatial and temporal correlations between detected signal. 

ATMCorrCof is a set of Julia routines to evaluate the correlation level introduced by the atmosphere for different scanning strategy and atmosphere parameters.
The suite was customized for the STRIP instrument, that will be placed at Osservatorio del Teide (Tenerife) in early 2020.
